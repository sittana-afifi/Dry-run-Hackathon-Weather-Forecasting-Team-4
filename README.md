# 1. Data Preprocessing
# Responsible Team Member: Ahmed Elshamy / Islam Mohamed

The preprocessing pipeline transforms the Cairo weather dataset into sequences suitable for transformer-based forecasting models. This comprehensive data preparation phase ensures optimal model performance by systematically cleaning, transforming, and structuring the raw weather data.

## Dataset Information
- **Source**: Cairo Weather Dataset
- **Target Variable**: `temperature_2m_mean (°C)`
- **Prediction Task**: Temperature forecasting using historical weather patterns
- **Sequence Length**: 7 days lookback window
- **Forecast Horizon**: 14 days ahead

## Preprocessing Steps Performed

### Data Cleaning and Quality Assessment
The initial data exploration revealed several data quality issues that required systematic handling. Missing values, undefined measurements, and irrelevant features were identified and addressed through strategic column removal and data type conversions.

**Removed Columns:**
- `visibility_mean (undefined)`, `visibility_min (undefined)`, `visibility_max (undefined)` - Contained undefined values
- `snowfall_sum (cm)` - Irrelevant for Cairo's climate conditions
- `sunrise (iso8601)`, `sunset (iso8601)` - Redundant temporal information

### Feature Engineering and Transformation
Time-based features underwent careful transformation to maintain temporal relationships while enabling effective model training. The datetime column was converted to numeric representation while preserving chronological order essential for time series forecasting.

### Data Normalization and Scaling
Standardization was applied using separate scalers for features and target variables:
- **Features**: StandardScaler normalization (μ=0, σ=1) to prevent feature dominance
- **Target**: Independent StandardScaler for temperature values to maintain prediction accuracy
- **Purpose**: Ensures stable gradient flow and consistent learning across all features

### Sequence Generation for Time Series
The core transformation involved converting the time series data into supervised learning sequences:
- **Input Structure**: 7-day historical weather sequences
- **Output Structure**: Next-day temperature prediction
- **Method**: Sliding window approach maximizing data utilization
- **Temporal Integrity**: Maintains chronological relationships critical for forecasting

### Train-Test Data Splitting
A temporal split strategy was implemented to ensure realistic evaluation:
- **Split Ratio**: 80% training, 20% testing
- **Method**: Chronological split without shuffling
- **Rationale**: Simulates real-world forecasting scenarios where future data is unavailable

# 2. Model Training
# Responsible Team Member: Ahmed Elshamy / Hadil Mouzai / Abdalla Essam

The model training phase involved developing and training two distinct transformer architectures: a classical baseline and a quantum-enhanced variant. Both models were designed with comparable complexity to ensure fair performance comparison.

## Model Architectures Implemented

### Classical Transformer Baseline
The classical transformer serves as the performance benchmark, implementing traditional multi-head attention mechanisms with enhanced processing layers. The architecture includes 5 transformer blocks with 4 attention heads each, designed to capture complex temporal dependencies in weather patterns.

**Key Components:**
- Multi-head attention with classical processing enhancement
- Feed-forward networks with ReLU activation
- Layer normalization and residual connections
- Dropout regularization for generalization

### Quantum-Enhanced Transformer
The quantum transformer integrates quantum computing principles through PennyLane-implemented quantum circuits. This architecture replaces classical processing layers with quantum circuits featuring angle embedding and strongly entangling layers.

**Quantum Components:**
- 5-qubit quantum circuits with 4 repetition layers
- AngleEmbedding for classical-to-quantum data encoding
- StronglyEntanglingLayers for quantum feature processing
- Quantum-classical hybrid processing throughout the network

## Training Configuration and Process

### Hyperparameter Selection
Both models utilized identical training configurations to ensure fair comparison:
- **Optimizer**: Adam with learning rate 0.0001
- **Loss Function**: Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- **Batch Size**: 16 (optimized for memory efficiency)
- **Training Epochs**: 50 with early stopping
- **Regularization**: Dropout (0.1-0.3) and gradient clipping

### Training Challenges and Solutions
**Quantum Model Stability**: Quantum circuits initially showed gradient instability, resolved through:
- Enhanced numerical stability controls
- Gradient clipping and weight normalization
- Bounded activation functions and careful weight initialization

**Memory Optimization**: Large sequence processing required:
- Batch size optimization for GPU memory constraints
- Efficient data loading and preprocessing pipelines
- Model checkpointing for training resumption

### Model Selection Rationale
Transformer architectures were chosen for their proven effectiveness in sequence modeling and attention-based pattern recognition. The quantum enhancement specifically targets the hypothesis that quantum superposition and entanglement can improve complex pattern recognition in weather data.
